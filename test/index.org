#+TITLE: pubme org mode website
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Elwin
#+GIT-PUBLISH-URL: ./pubmegit
Testing the features of the pubme org-mode publishing script.

* Usage
1. Each website is a nested structure of =.org= mode files.
2. Running =pubme= inside this directory structure will generate an =html= directory with the website.
   #+BEGIN_folded
   =pubme= is both an emacs script file and a shell script (using emacs as the interpreter)
   #+END_folded
3. Files stored under =private/=  will not be published
3. Setting =#+GIT-PUBLISH-URL= sets the url to a remote git repository. Running =pubme -p= will push the website to that repository.

* Testing 
  This section and those below serve as a test of pubme's capabilities.
  This is a top-level header[fn:myx]

[fn:myx] A footnote?

    Here is some =inline= of the ~src~
*** Test of overflow properties
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    echo "this is a very long line that will overflow so test it out, but it is not long enough yet so I will keep typing until it is"

** For developers:
In elisp code, use =\${pubme.BASE_DIR}= to expand to the relative path
of this file to the base directory (in this case it is =${pubme.BASE_DIR}=).
When using a string the =\= must itself be escaped (=\\=)
