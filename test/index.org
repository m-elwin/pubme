#+TITLE: pubme org mode website
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Elwin
#+GIT-PUBLISH-URL: ./pubmegit
Testing the features of the pubme org-mode publishing script.

* Usage
1. Each website is a nested structure of =.org= mode files.
2. Running =pubme= inside this directory structure will generate an =html= directory with the website.
   #+BEGIN_folded
   =pubme= is both an emacs script file and a shell script (using emacs as the interpreter)
   #+END_folded
3. Files stored under =private/=  will not be published
3. Setting =#+GIT-PUBLISH-URL= sets the url to a remote git repository. Running =pubme -p= will push the website to that repository.

* Testing 
  This section and those below serve as a test of pubme's capabilities.
