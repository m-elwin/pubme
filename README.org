#+TITLE: pubme org mode website
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Elwin
#+GIT-PUBLISH-URL: ./pubmegit
The org-mode publishing method that I use for my website.

* Directory Structure
1. Each website is a nested structure of =.org= mode files.
2. Running =pubme= inside this directory structure will generate an =html= directory with the website.
3. Files stored under =private/=  will not be published
3. Setting =#+GIT-PUBLISH-URL= sets the url to a remote git repository. Running =pubme -p= will push the website to that repository.

*** Test of overflow properties
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    echo "this is a very long line that will overflow so test it out, but it is not long enough yet so I will keep typing until it is"
