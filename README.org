#+TITLE: pubme org mode website
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Elwin
The org-mode publishing method that I use for my website.

* Usage
1. Each website is a nested structure of =.org= mode files.
2. Running =pubme= inside this directory structure will generate an =html= directory with the website.
   #+BEGIN_folded
   =pubme= is both an emacs script file and a shell script (using emacs as the interpreter)
   #+END_folded
3. Files stored under =private/=  will not be published
3. Setting =#+GIT-PUBLISH-URL= sets the url to a remote git repository. Running =pubme -p= will push the website to that repository.
4. See =test/= for an example of the features
